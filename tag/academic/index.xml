      <title>Leaving Academia</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-choices-we-make&#34;&gt;The choices we make!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major decisions that has haunted me through my PhD is whether I want to stay in academia or not. I sincerely love doing research, I love going to conferences, I love reading scientific papers and talking to other scholars. I even love giving talks and teaching, dissemination can be very rewarding and enjoyable. At some point I was certain that I would go for an academic career, but things change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I like is a fresh challenge. After having spent the summer at deCODE genetics, I saw the possibilities outside academia. Doing a PhD is a binary process, either you have a PhD or not (&lt;em&gt;Quote from my friend Óli Páll, who recited Professor Havard Rue from NTNU&lt;/em&gt;). Having obtained my PhD made me think differently about my own future, and what I could accomplish. We sometimes say, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;it is the journey, not the destination&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, I feel that doing a PhD is different, there is a certain destination, obtaining the degree! In that regard I did not allow myself to ponder other possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is good to evaluate your goals and values every now and then. I have certain goals that I would like to achieve 5, 10 and 20 years down the line. From my point of view, I have a higher likelihood of achieving these goals outside academia, at least if I stay there for some time. I would also feel good about returning to academia at some point, having experienced the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the important things my PhD supervisor made me realize is that the most valuable resource we possess is time. Time is a resource that we can &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; get back. We should use this resource to do something we believe in, do something that makes a difference and we enjoy. I am forever grateful for my experience and time at DTU, I will cherish the moments I had there for the rest of my life. But for me the time for a change is now, it is time to go somewhere else, meet new people, learn, grow and contribute to great things. I look forward to this new path and I am happy for the choice I made.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been waiting to read these for a while now!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Post!</title>
      <link>https://gumeo.github.io/post/first-post/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;starting-a-blog&#34;&gt;Starting a blog&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is to try to do weekly to monthly blogposts about something interesting I learn. I might also write up technical details about setting something up as a reference for my future self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to use the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt; package to manage this blog, with the hugo theme 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dplesca.github.io/purehugo/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;purehugo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The main reason I chose this is because I think it scales well for mobile devices and it looks clean and minimal. I will probably add an about section and some other stuff/fluff later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time that I start a blog, I also have my own 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~guei/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;academic page/blog&lt;/a&gt;. I just don&amp;rsquo;t post there regularly. Removing some of the overhead, by managing the content/posts as Rmarkdown documents, will hopefully make me more productive as a blogger.&lt;/p&gt;
