      <description>I have to lose weight The reasons I am going through some weightloss has some history behind it, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to briefly outline that.
Knee Injury End of July 2017 I was extremely unlucky and had an accident in BJJ, where I fully ruptured the PCL, LCL and popliteus tendon (where it connects to the fibula) in my left knee. We have four ligaments in the knee, one on each lateral side, and then the front (ACL) and back (PCL) cross ligaments.</description>

      <description>The choices we make! One of the major decisions that has haunted me through my PhD is whether I want to stay in academia or not. I sincerely love doing research, I love going to conferences, I love reading scientific papers and talking to other scholars. I even love giving talks and teaching, dissemination can be very rewarding and enjoyable. At some point I was certain that I would go for an academic career, but things change.</description>

      <title>Part 2: Deep Learning with Closures in R</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s go on! If you just arrived, you can check out the first part here. The goal of this series is to demonstrate how compactly we can implement an MLP in a functional programming paradigm and how easy it becomes to extend/play around with it. This post is aimed at the R person that wants to get into deep learning or anyone curious about how these things are implemented. Another goal is to visualize what is happening in a neural network during training in hope to get a deeper understanding of what is going on.</description>

      <description>Start of a small series The gif below is the evolution of the weights from a neural network trained on the mnist dataset. Mnist is a dataset of handwritten digits, and is kind of the hello world/FizzBuzz of machine learning. It is maybe not a very challenging data set, but you can learn a lot from it. This is a 10 by 10 grid of images, where each individual small patch represents weights going to a single neuron in the first hidden layer of the network.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Strange Attractors</title>

      <description>What is a strange attractor? The wikipedia article on attractors gives the following definition/explanation:
 An attractor is called strange if it has a fractal structure. This is often the case when the dynamics on it are chaotic, but strange nonchaotic attractors also exist. If a strange attractor is chaotic, exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions, then any two arbitrarily close alternative initial points on the attractor, after any of various numbers of iterations, will lead to points that are arbitrarily far apart (subject to the confines of the attractor), and after any of various other numbers of iterations will lead to points that are arbitrarily close together.</description>

      <description>Starting a blog The plan is to try to do weekly to monthly blogposts about something interesting I learn. I might also write up technical details about setting something up as a reference for my future self.
I chose to use the blogdown package to manage this blog, with the hugo theme purehugo. The main reason I chose this is because I think it scales well for mobile devices and it looks clean and minimal.</description>
